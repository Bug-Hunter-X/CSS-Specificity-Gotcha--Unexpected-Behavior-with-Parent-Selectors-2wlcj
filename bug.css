The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

In this case, both selectors target the same element (`p`), but the first selector (`div p`) is more specific because it includes an additional parent element (`div`). The browser will prioritize the more specific selector, resulting in the paragraph text being blue even if the general `p` selector has higher precedence based on order.

This can lead to unexpected behavior and is difficult to debug because it involves an often overlooked aspect of specificity.
